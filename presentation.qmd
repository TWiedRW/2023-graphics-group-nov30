# Overview

- A study on 3D printed graphs
- Integration with STAT 218

# A study on 3D printed graphs

## Inspiration

In 1984, Cleveland and McGill conducted studies on elementary perceptual tasks (EPTs)

- Basic building blocks of how people extract quantitative information from graphs

## Inspiration

Cleveland and McGill conducted two studies comparing position along a common scale, length, and angle

- Participants had to estimate the ratio between two measurements

- Accuracy: Position > Length > Angle

## Inspiration

The theory for volume comparisons was ranked low by Cleveland and McGill. Several studies (some references here) show that people make less accurate judements using 3D graphs than 2D graphs.

## Designing a study

Partially replicate Cleveland and McGill using similar graphs and ratio comparisons.

- Ratios
- Graph type
- Comparisons adjacent or separated (Type 1/3)

## Results from pilot study

Sample size of around 40 participants, consisting of members of the UNL department of statistics and their adult roommates.

- Response: $\log_2(|\text{Observed}-\text{Actual}| + 1/8)$
- Nothing significant!
