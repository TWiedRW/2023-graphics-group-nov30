	abstract = {Manipulating the way a graph is drawn influences viewers' ability to extract information from it. In a series of experiments with simple bar graphs, the authors varied the rendering characteristics and relative heights of the bars and asked participants to estimate the quantities portrayed. The addition of 3-dimensional (3D) perspective depth cues lowered accuracy. This accuracy disadvantage diminished when a short delay was introduced before judgments were reported. The height of the judged bar relative to nearby graphical elements also affected accuracy; this effect was about 1 order of magnitude larger and remained intact when the delay was introduced. Nearby elements also affected viewers' bias (under- or overestimation). These effects do not seem to be due to misestimation of object depth. The results suggest that warnings about accuracy decrements due to 3D shading may be overstated, whereas distortions due to neighboring elements should be of more concern.
